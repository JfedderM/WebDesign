# Skyrim

## A Game by Bethesda

Skyrim is an open world role playing game set in a fantasy world where a player can interact with NPCs, start quests, and explore freely. It's one of my favorite games because of the storyline, many opportunities for different adventures, and the fact that a player is not forced to complete the gane in a certain order.
