# Assignment 1 Reflection

The feedback I chose to incorporate was correcting spelling errors and improving paragraph formatting. One suggestion I got was to add small dragons to the page. I did like the idea it would of been fun to have little dragons flying around my page but i had already decided to add pictures. I focused on spelling and paragraph structure becaise it made my page an easier read.

Some changes I made to my page were the color, layout, added media, and text. I liked the original colors i chose, but i felt the page looked a little falt so i added a gradient to the background. I used the same font throughout the page and changed the color of the text to flow with the background gradient. I feel these changes all together made my page look visually balanced.
